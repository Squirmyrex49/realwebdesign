        <h2 id="part1">5. Pleasant Park</h2>
<p>
    <img class="smallimager" src="images/pleasant.jpg" alt="small pic">
One of the most well known points of interest in the game's history. Pleasant Park usually had lots of people
and not enough loot making it very dangerous in the early game. On top of that there was a large open soccerfield and gazebo in the middle providing little to
no cover if you needed to get across. And on top of all that it was located in the top left corner of the map usually far away from first circle.

        <h2 id="part2">4. The Block</h2>
<p>
    <img class="smallimage" src="images\block.jpg" alt="large pic">
The Block was a POI in the top right corner of the map which right away is a problem if first circle is far away. The thing that made The Block special was
that it was a community made location that would completely change every week attracting lots of players and often offering little ammounts of loot to go with it.
Depending on the week the map would lack cover and be very open making it incredibly dangerous to get from one side to the other.

    <h2 id="part3">3. <em>Coral Castle</em></h2>
<p> 
<img class="smallimager" src="images\coral.jpg" alt="large pic">
Similar to the past two on this list Coral Castle was in the top left corner of the map and surrounded by water making getting to circle a big problem.
The location would often only have one or two team land at it per match allowing there to be a good amount of loot. However there was not alot of materials
to be harvested there which is what made it so abandoned.

    <h2 id="part4">2. <em>Sleepy Sounds</em></h2>
<p>
<img class="smallimage" src="images\sleepy.jpg" alt="large pic">
Also a pretty popular spot Sleepy Sound was one of the biggest POIs in the chapter three map. With lots of people landing there the size
would become a problem. Going from building to building or trying to get to the otherside to help a teammate was very dangerous. It would be a long run between lots of fightings.
However the location offered lots of loot and a good supply of materials

    <h2 id="part5">1. <em>Haunted Hills</em> </h2>
<p>
<img class="smallimager" src="images\haunted.jpg" alt="large pic">
The worst place to land is Haunted Hills. It offered low amounts of loot and often had a handful of teams land there. Its positioning was also one of if not the worst.
located in the top left corner of the map and with a giant mountain blocking the most direct path to the middle of the map, getting to circle after landing here is a nightmare.
